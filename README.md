# WDS Treasurer v.2.0

This program was created to help me partially automate the task of filling in Google reimbursement forms for a college debate organization. It's based off [another program](https://github.com/angelinahli/wds-treasurer) I wrote some time ago.

My main objective in writing this program is to help me think more about class hierarchy and general code organization.

## Program overview

Input data:
* Google sheet where each row contains information about a specific reimbursement that a student has requested
* Google sheet where each row contains information about a specific student and their contact information

Output:
* List of forms where each form contains all the information needed to submit a form for one students' reimbursements (with a limit of 5 reimbursements associated with each student).
* Output might be formatted in a more user friendly way - e.g. sent as an email to a specific person or formatted as an html page.
